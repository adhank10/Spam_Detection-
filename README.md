# Spam Detection Project

Spam Detection is a machine learning project aimed at classifying text messages as either spam or not spam (ham). This repository contains the code and resources used for building a Spam Detection model using natural language processing techniques.


## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying spam messages accurately. We use natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

We used a labeled dataset containing both spam and ham messages for training and evaluation. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/data . The dataset consists of text messages and their corresponding labels.
